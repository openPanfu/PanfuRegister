# PanfuRegister
## Disclamer
The code and assets were originally created by **goodbeans GmbH**, the ActionScript code and assets have simply been decompiled and cleaned up by OpenPanfu contributers.

Code may differ from the original to allow for customization.

## Usage

### Assets

Assets come as *.fla* files, these have to be compiled into swfs with **Adobe Flash Professional**.

(While not officially supported, it is possible to use **Adobe Animate** but this will require you to install the flash 10.0 or 9 SWC.)

### Flex Code
Included with the files is Compile.sh and Compile.bat, however it is adviced to use an IDE like IntelliJ, to compile you will need to download the FlexSDK 4.1(A) and add it to your PATH.

The final output will be *PanfuRegister.swf*.
